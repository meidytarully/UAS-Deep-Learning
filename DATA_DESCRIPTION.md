#### Anki Flashcards
Medicine as a whole encompasses a wide range of subjects that medical students and graduates must master in order to practice effectively. This includes a deep understanding of basic medical sciences, clinical knowledge, and clinical skills. The Anki Medical Curriculum flashcards are created and updated by medical students and cover the entirety of this curriculum, addressing subjects such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and more. These flashcards frequently feature succinct summaries and mnemonics to aid in learning and retention of vital medical concepts.

In our study, we employed the flashcards as a resource for generating question-answer pairs for training purposes. After removing cards that contained images, we utilized OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to rephrase the cards into coherent, contextually relevant question-answer pairs. In general the questions and answers are short and focused, as the flashcards do not allow to add much information.

#### StackExchange 
Our dataset consists of 52,475 question-answer pairs obtained from five Stack Exchange forums related to biomedical sciences and related fields. Specifically, we gathered the data from answers that head at least five upvotes in the forums concering Academia, Bioinformatics, Biology, Fitness, and Health, and matched them to the corresponding question. You can find the full Stack Exchange dataset, where the five different categories can be extraxted from, [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/stack-exchange-preferences).

#### WikiDoc
We incorporated medical question-answer pairs extracted from [WikiDoc](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Main_Page), a collaborative platform for medical professionals to share and contribute to up-to-date medical knowledge. The platform has to main subsites, the "Living Textbook" and "Patient Information". The "Living Textbook" contains chapters for various medical specialties, which we crawled. We then used GTP-3.5-Turbo to rephrase the paragraph heading to a question and used the paragraph as answer.  Patient Information is structured differently, in that each section subheading is already a question, making rephrasing them obsolete.  
**Note:** This dataset is still a WIP. While the Q/A pairs from the patient information seems to be mostly correct, the conversion using GPT-3.5-Turbo yielded some unsatisfactory results in  approximately 30% of cases. We are in the process of cleaning this dataset. 

#### USMLE Self assessment
The USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination) provides a set of self assessment questions for medical students to evaluate, if they are likels to pass the Exam. For each of the three steps, they provide about 120 questions, which is equal to approximately half the amount of questions a student needs to answer during the real exam. As these questions provide a realsitic knowledge benchmark, covering all relevant medical areas, we use them explicitly for testing our models. 

#### Wikipedia
We have crawled all medical articles on the German and English Wikipedia and are currently in the process of converting them to Q/A pairs.

#### COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 1,000,000 scholarly articles, including over 400,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. 
The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) or, if you want to use our slightly processed version [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_cord19).

#### MedQA
This is the data and baseline source code for the paper: Jin, Di, et al. "What Disease does this Patient Have? A Large-scale Open Domain Question Answering Dataset from Medical Exams." 

From https://github.com/jind11/MedQA:
>The data that contains both the QAs and textbooks can be downloaded from [this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ImYUSLk9JbgHXOemfvyiDiirluZHPeQw/view?usp=sharing). A bit of details of data are explained as below:
>
> For QAs, we have three sources: US, Mainland of China, and Taiwan District, which are put in folders, respectively. All files for QAs are in jsonl file format, where each line is a data sample as a dict. The "XX_qbank.jsonl" files contain all data samples while we also provide an official random split into train, dev, and test sets. Those files in the "metamap" folders are extracted medical related phrases using the Metamap tool.
>
> For QAs, we also include the "4_options" version in for US and Mainland of China since we reported results for 4 options in the paper.
>
> For textbooks, we have two languages: English and simplified Chinese. For simplified Chinese, we provide two kinds of sentence spliting: one is split by sentences, and the other is split by paragraphs.

If you would like to use the data, please cite the paper. The prepared dataset is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_medqa)

#### OpenAssistant Datset
Although, this is not a medical dataste per se, it is a high quality instruction dataset covering multiple languages and was thus also included into our dataset. At this timepoint, the dataset is still in gated access, so we cannot link it directly. Please refer to https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant, where it will likely be published, once final. 

## Acessing the data
We have parsed all dataset to a uniform format and uploaded them to the hugginface repository. With them you can curate your very own version of the **Medical Meadow** tailored to your specific needs. Check out the data at https://huggingface.co/medalpaca
